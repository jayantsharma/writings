## Trek route for NOLS TLI

As part of the Trip Leader India course that I did last year, we hiked for 17 days across a number of villages in the Kumaon Garhwal region (mostly former) of Uttarakhand. We lived entirely out of our rucksacks during this period, with one resupply and occassionaly buying veggies from villages en route. Here's the route in its entirety.

* 20 Oct (Day 1)
** Drive from Ranikhet to Gwaldam (~ 8 hours) -> Batra Himni - camped in the school grounds

* 21 Oct (Day 2)
** Batra Himni -> ridge-line above Dulam (pastures)
Gradually ascending walk to a ridgeline adjoining Dulam, then ascending steeply to the ridgeline above Dulam

* 22 Oct (Day 3)
** From Dulam, take the main trail to cross a minor pass, descending and camping on the meadows below. Martoli, I think.

* 23 Oct (Day 4)
** Rest day. Interesting walk up to a hill-top near the yesterday's saddle.

* 24 Oct (Day 5)
** Martoli - Barkani -> Balra -> Bora -> Malbora/Malbara/Mal bho. These are the pastures above the village of Bora.

* 25 Oct (Day 6)
** Malbora -> cross pass with walnut tree on summit -> Badiyakot/Garkuti -> Pittad (village)

* 26 Oct (Day 7)
** Pittad -> Sorag -> Wacham. Slaughter, cook and eat a goat if you get to here :)

* 27 Oct (Day 8) - Birthday yay!
** Wacham -> Khati -> camped below Khati khal, the pass above the village

* 28 Oct (Day 9)
** Woke up early, crossed Khati khal, and camped at the first site on the other side.

* 29 Oct (Day 10)
** Rest day. Walked upto Khati khal, walking up the ridge to Pakhwa top. This is a nice hill-top affording good views of the Sunderdunga and Pindari valleys on a clear day.

* 30 Oct (Day 11)
** Khati khal -> Jhundi (upper village) -> Baicham -> Bhadra Tunga. Bhadra Tunga is the temple on the valley floor, surrounded by tall Deodars. Camped in the temple grounds.

* 31 Oct (Day 12)
** Bhadra Tunga -> Kalpettay -> Bhainsia Kharak. Camped at some random GPS point on the meadows.

* 1 Nov (Day 13)
** Bhainsia Kharak -> cross pass -> camp on the meadows Raj Kharak near the confluence of a couple streams. Also known as Lamdhara locally, which is the name for the long ridge on the skyline, but the name probably applies to nearby regions too.

* 2 Nov (Day 14)
** Raj Kharak -> cross river, head up the mountain, rounding it and heading to the village Keemu, near Mobir. Camped on the temple ground, which is situated right at the edge of a tall cliff.

* 4 Nov (Day 15)
** Keemu -> Namik

* 5 Nov (Day 16)
** Namik -> cross pass -> camp on pastures next to shepherd huts on the other side.

* 7 Nov (Day 17)
** Early morning walk to the village Birthi (which apparently is a marijuana haven). 8 hour drive back to Ranikhet from here.
