<h1>1.25L for a laptop. How ?</h1>

<p>When you're trying to set up your freelancing career, and your sole Netbook (Baytrail, with just a 8GB working arch install) goes kaput, and it still doesn't dawn on you that you need a new machine, then for sure you need a check-up. But first, I had to rush to Chandigarh from Manali asap to get my <strong>X205TA</strong> sorted. It was still under warranty, so small reprieve there. </p>

<p>My first thoughts post-realisation was to go for a <strong>Macbook</strong>. Solid rep, never heard of one crashing, and minimalist looks. I asked around, and the price-tag nearly had me in tears. PK, my college wing-mate suggested to take a look at Linux laptops, marketed as such by the industry. </p>

<p>My favored linux distro is <em>arch</em>, and my laptop search centered around it. Reddit threads and others had a number of people passionately advocating for Thinkpads, while also bashing Lenovo for it's current state of machines with no ThinkLight, Trackpad issues and more. Saw <strong>T440</strong> mentioned quite a lot. Another machine that caught my eye was <strong>Dell XPS 13</strong>. </p>

<p>Dell XPS 13's best model has a 6th gen ULV i7 with 8GB LPDDR3 RAM. 256GB SSD and a QHD+ 13" screen with touch-screen as cherry on the pie. Listed online at 1.46L, can be bought off retails stores at around 1.25L. </p>

<p>Now MBP has never been a favourite among Linux users, because of it's policy of not disclosing hardware specs and generally, poor and/or unreliable driver support. The top of the range 13" MBP offers an i7-5557U processor (5th gen) with 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage. Not to mention, the Retina display which is basically their invented name for their high dpi screen. Cost : 1.35L (with student discount). Great specs on paper for the cost, have to admit. No point bashing the mainstream favorite here.</p>

<p>Enter business-class laptops. Lenovo T440 and W-series. Dell Precisions. HP Elitebooks. Rugged builds and multiple-year on-site warranties. </p>

<p>I took a serious look at Lenovo <strong>T440</strong> and <strong>W541</strong>. Both are <em>MIL-SPEC</em> tested; you could basically sit in a warzone and write programs is what that means. The W541 has been described as a portable-beast and a tank. i7-4710 MQ(4th gen quad-core), coupled w 8GB RAM and 1 TB HDD. 15.6" FHD TN display. Weighing in at 2.5 kgs as their <em>lightest</em> business-class laptop, it comes with a 3-year on-site warranty. Combined with the fact that Lenovos have had great Linux support historically, this looked like the machine to buy. Priced at 1.25 lakhs, cheaper than the extremely pricey Dell m4800 with the lowest specs.</p>

<p>After 3 days of extensive research and numerous cpu comparison tests, the winner is W541. This better not disappoint me! </p>
